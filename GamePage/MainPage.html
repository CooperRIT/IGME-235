            <blockquote>
                Whether or not it's the best, this is certainly the most audacious Monster Hunter game. 
                World takes a dramatic leap into a look, feel, and size that feels truly new, simultaneously staying true to the series’ ideals by maintaining the addictive loop of combat, intimidating monsters and meaningful upgrades that fans love. 
                The sheer depth and commitment required is still intense, but it clearly isn’t Capcom’s aim to court a casual crowd. 
                This is as all-consuming and incredible a ride as ever.
